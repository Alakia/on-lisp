This is my personal working-through of the book. I've incorporated some fixes to the code based on pg's own errata, poring over old mailing list postings, and hitting the code with a hammer until it works. Much of the example code from the book has been converted into stefil and lisp-unit tests.

The PDF file of the book available from Paul Graham's site isn't so great for reading on a screen. A version with smaller margins and the missing figures re-added can be found here: http://www.lurklurk.org/onlisp/onlisp.html

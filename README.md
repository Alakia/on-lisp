This is my personal working-through of the book. I've incorporated some fixes to the code by looking at [pg's errata](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisperrata.html), poring over decade-old mailing list archives, pestering the lovable fellas on #lisp, and hitting the code with a hammer until it works. Most of the example code executions from the book have been converted into stefil and lisp-unit tests by hitting them with a hammer until they work.

The PDF file of the book available from Paul Graham's site isn't so great for reading on a screen. A version with smaller margins and the missing figures re-added can be found [here](http://www.lurklurk.org/onlisp/onlisp.html). Figure 20.2 is missing a line between 2 and 3.

An online HTML version of the book, minus graphical figures, can be found [here](http://dunsmor.com/lisp/onlisp/onlisp.html).
